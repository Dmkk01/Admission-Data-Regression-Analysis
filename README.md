# Deep Learning Regression with Admissions Data

A project from Codecademy: [Build Deep Learning Models with TensorFlow](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/paths/build-deep-learning-models-with-tensorflow) skil path.

## Project Prompt

For this project, you will create a deep learning regression model that predicts the likelihood that a student applying to graduate school will be accepted based on various application factors (such as test scores).

By analyzing the parameters in this [graduate admissions dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mohansacharya/graduate-admissions?select=Admission_Predict_Ver1.1.csv), you will use TensorFlow with Keras to create a regression model that can evaluate the chances of an applicant being admitted. You hope this will give you further insight into the graduate admissions world and improve your test prep strategy.

## Requirements

- Python
- pip
